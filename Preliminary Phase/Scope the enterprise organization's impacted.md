**Core Impacted Units**

1. **IT Department:** As the central hub for technology and systems, the IT department will be heavily involved in implementing the EA. They will need to align current systems with the new architecture, manage the transition, and ensure ongoing support.
2. **Strategy and Business Development:** This unit will use the EA to align future business strategies with IT capabilities, ensuring that new initiatives are supported by robust technology solutions.
3. **Operations:** The operations team will experience significant changes in processes and systems as the EA is likely to streamline and automate many functions, leading to efficiency gains.
4. **Research and Development (R&D):** As innovation is a key driver for Farm Corporation, the R&D unit will be deeply impacted by the EA, which will facilitate the integration of new technologies and accelerate product development.

**Soft Impacted Units**

1. **Marketing and Sales:** While not directly involved in the architecture, these units will need to adapt to new CRM and sales enablement tools that the EA will introduce, impacting their daily operations.
2. **Human Resources (HR):** HR will need to manage the change process, including training and possibly recruiting new talent with skills aligned to the EA.
3. **Finance:** The finance department will be indirectly impacted through the integration of new financial management systems and reporting tools.

**Extended Impacted Units**

1. **Supply Chain Partners:** As external entities, suppliers and distributors will need to interface with our new systems, which may require changes to their own systems and processes.
2. **Dealers and Distributors:** They may need to adapt to new ordering and inventory management systems, which could impact their operations and IT systems.
3. **Regulatory Bodies:** Changes in data management and reporting as part of the EA may require compliance with new standards and regulations affecting these external stakeholders.

**Impacted Communities**

1. **Customers:** They may experience changes in how they interact with Farm Corporation, through enhanced digital platforms or new service offerings.
2. **Local Communities:** If the business transformation includes new manufacturing practices or facilities, this could have environmental and economic effects on the surrounding communities.
3. **Industry Groups:** As Farm Corporation adopts a leading-edge EA, it may influence industry standards and practices, affecting peer organizations and professional communities.

The extent of the impact will vary based on the depth of the EA implementation within each unit and the degree of interdependence between the units and the core IT infrastructure. The Preliminary phase will also involve setting up the governance structures, defining principles, and establishing the EA team, which will further clarify the extent of the impact on these units.
