## Farmer first strategy

Passion for farmers’ success and the vital work they do to feed our growing population is at the core of who we are as a business. We listen carefully to farmers to understand their challenges, and then place those challenges at the center of our approaches to service, innovation and distribution.

Providing farmers with exceptional customer experiences that live up to our brands’ promises is key to connecting with farmers and building brand loyalty. We actively seek and respond to farmer feedback to optimize each element of the ownership cycle, from purchase consideration to replacement. Our solutions are backed by the parts, service, support and education farmers count on to keep their operations running smoothly season after season.

Our smart solutions give farmers the tools they need to succeed and thrive. We leverage the innovation and know-how of our global brands to develop solutions that help farmers make more informed decisions that improve yield, improve efficiency, and minimize inputs. Our innovation is well-recognized in the industry, with Farm corp brands winning a full 20 percent of the AE50 awards in 2022.

Making it easy for farmers to do business with our brands remains a priority, and our dealers play an important role in helping us achieve this vision. Working together with our dealers, we are continuing to optimize our online presence and tools to enhance farmers’ experiences of our brands outside the dealership.

## Improved outcomes through technology

Our vision is to be farmers’ trusted partner for industry-leading, smart farming solutions, and our award-winning portfolio of equipment and digital solutions brings that vision to life.

We are automating the features and processes that improve farmer outcomes today and continuing to innovate for the future, with plans to offer fully autonomous solutions by 2030.

We are pioneering the next generation of sustainable power through our development of electric, hydrogen, and alternative-fuel powertrains. We are also continually expanding our technology offerings and capabilities through targeted acquisitions and partnerships.

Unique in our industry, many of our farmer-focused solutions are first available as a retrofit solution on other brands of equipment, enabling farmers to get more value from their existing fleet.

## Delivering value through sustainability

We are committed to helping farmers achieve their sustainability outcomes without compromising yield or profitability. Our innovative solutions increase yield, improve productivity, and reduce costs while enabling farmers to reduce emissions, reduce input waste, and protect their land. Delivering that triple-win of farmer productivity, profitability and sustainability is core to achieving our purpose of farmer-focused solutions to sustainably feed our world.

Our precision agriculture products enlist sensors and other technologies to optimize the use of inputs so farmers can produce more with less inputs, energy and time while advancing soil health. These smart solutions support carbon sequestration and precise management of resources. This year, we introduced Radicle Agronomics, a unique approach to in-field soil testing that takes accuracy and timely agronomic understanding to a new level.

Balancing performance with sustainability, the new Farm corp Power CORE diesel engine offers high fuel economy with low emissions. Further innovations, like the Fendt e100, will leverage electricity and alternative fuel sources. These innovations ensure farmers can reduce emissions while counting on Farm corp’s industry-leading performance and reliability.

Advancing animal welfare is a key priority in our protein-production brands, including enlisting state-of-the-art software, environmental control systems and robotics to monitor and protect animals while improving productivity.

Everything we do for our farmers starts with our employees. We have been steadily working to advance diversity, equity and inclusion in our workplaces, and to ensure that our employees feel valued, empowered, and heard. Offering our employees safe work environments that prioritize health and well-being is key to attracting and retaining our talented, dedicated workforce.
