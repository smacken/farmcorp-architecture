1. **Enterprise Architecture Management Capability**:
    
    - **Resolution**: Expand the enterprise architecture team, provide comprehensive training in TOGAF, and invest in EA management tools.
    - **Impact**: Strengthening this capability will enable better strategic alignment and more effective implementation of IT projects. However, the organization may initially face challenges in adapting to new EA processes and tools.
2. **Solution Architecture and Design Capability**:
    
    - **Resolution**: Develop a center of excellence for solution architecture, adopt best practices for modular and scalable design, and encourage knowledge sharing.
    - **Impact**: This will lead to more robust and innovative IT solutions, although there may be a period of adjustment as teams adapt to new design principles and collaboration practices.
3. **Data Management and Analytics Capability**:
    
    - **Resolution**: Implement a data governance framework, invest in data analytics platforms, and train staff in data science and analytics.
    - **Impact**: Enhanced data capabilities will drive data-driven decision-making, though the business must manage the cultural shift towards a more data-centric approach.
4. **Cybersecurity Capability**:
    
    - **Resolution**: Conduct a cybersecurity audit, update policies and protocols, and invest in advanced security technologies and staff training.
    - **Impact**: Improving cybersecurity will protect against data breaches and ensure compliance, but will require ongoing investment and vigilance to maintain security standards.
5. **Cloud Computing and Infrastructure Capability**:
    
    - **Resolution**: Create a cloud migration strategy, train staff on cloud technologies, and establish partnerships with cloud service providers.
    - **Impact**: Moving to the cloud will provide scalability and cost savings but will involve complex migration efforts and potential service interruptions during the transition.
6. **Change and Release Management Capability**:
    
    - **Resolution**: Implement change management best practices, invest in release automation tools, and provide training for change agents.
    - **Impact**: Better change and release management will minimize disruption from new releases, though it requires building a culture that embraces continuous improvement and change.

**Assessment of Impacts**:

1. **Resource Reallocation**:
    
    - Investing in the development of IT capabilities may require shifting resources from other areas, impacting short-term productivity but providing long-term strategic benefits.
2. **Operational Efficiency**:
    
    - As IT capabilities mature, operational efficiency is expected to improve, leading to cost savings and better service delivery. However, the transition period may temporarily impact current operations.
3. **Employee Skill Development**:
    
    - Enhancing IT capabilities will necessitate upskilling and reskilling employees, which can improve job satisfaction and retention but will require a significant investment in training and development.
4. **Cultural Change**:
    
    - The shift towards a more mature IT capability landscape will drive a cultural change within the organization, fostering innovation and agility. Employees must be supported through this change to ensure buy-in and minimize resistance.
5. **Risk Management**:
    
    - As IT capabilities evolve, the organization will be better equipped to manage risks, particularly related to cybersecurity and data privacy. This proactive risk management approach will be critical in maintaining trust and compliance.

By addressing these IT capability gaps, Farm Corporation will be better positioned to commence and execute the architecture project successfully, aligning IT with business strategies and enhancing overall business performance.
