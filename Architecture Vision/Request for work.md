## Change request process

For the architecture program at Farm Corporation, a structured change of scope procedure is essential to maintain alignment with our strategic objectives while adapting to emerging needs and challenges. Any proposed changes to the architecture will be subject to a formal change request process to ensure they are evaluated and approved before implementation.

The procedure for a change of scope begins with the submission of a detailed change request by the project team or stakeholders. This request should outline the nature of the change, the rationale behind it, the impact on existing components of the architecture, and any implications for the timeline, budget, or resources. Upon submission, the change request will be reviewed by the Architecture Review Board (ARB), which includes representatives from relevant business and IT domains.

The ARB will assess the change request against the program's strategic goals, its potential benefits, and the risks it may introduce. They will consider factors such as alignment with the overall enterprise architecture, compliance with standards, and interoperability with existing systems. The ARB may request additional information, suggest modifications, or consult with other stakeholders as part of their review.

If the ARB approves the change request, it will be documented, and the project's scope will be officially updated. The approved changes will then be communicated to all affected parties, and the project plan will be adjusted accordingly. The ARB will also be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the change to ensure it delivers the expected outcomes.

This change of scope procedure ensures that Farm Corporation's architecture program remains flexible yet controlled, allowing for continuous improvement while mitigating the risks associated with unplanned or unapproved changes.
