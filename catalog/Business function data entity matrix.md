[[Information systems architecture]]

The purpose of the Data Entity/Business Function matrix is to depict the relationship between data entities and business functions within the enterprise. 
- The mapping of the Data Entity-Business Function relationship enables the following to take place: 
	- Assignment of ownership of data entities to organizations 
	- Understand the data and information exchange requirements business services 
	- Support the gap analysis and determine whether any data entities are missing and need to be created 
	- Define system of origin, system of record, and system of reference for data entities 
	- Enable development of data governance programs across the enterprise (establish data steward, develop data standards pertinent to the business function, etc.)
