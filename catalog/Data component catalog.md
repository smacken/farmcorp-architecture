The purpose of the Data Entity/Data Component catalog is to identify and maintain a list of all the data use across the enterprise, including data entities and also the data components where data entities are stored. An agreed Data Entity/Data Component catalog supports the definition and application of information management and data governance policies and also encourages effective data sharing and re-use.

The Data Entity/Data Component catalog contains the following metamodel entities:

- Data Entity
- Logical Data Component
- Physical Data Component
