## Getting started

The project is based off an Obsidian vault in order to manage and structure the architecture repository.
1. Download and install Obsidian https://obsidian.md/download
	1. To the right of **Open folder as vault**, click **Open**.
	2. In the file browser, select the folder you want to use as your vault.
	3. Click **Open**.
2. _Optional:_ Download Visual Paradigm https://www.visual-paradigm.com/
	1. Select **View > Project Browser** from the toolbar
	2. Click on the **Open Project Browser** on the right-hand side of the navigation bar of any diagram
	3. Select the Farm Corp project
3. Business context
	1. View business background and context incl annual reports, forward looking statements from the board of directors, company strategies etc.

> **Note:** Obsidian is required to view diagrams within markdown documents. Image links won't resolve using Github .md viewer.

## Methodology

The TOGAF Architecture Development Method (ADM) offers a structured approach for organizations to develop, manage, and evolve their enterprise architecture. It consists of the following phases:

1. **[[Preliminary Phase]]**: Establishes the organizational context for enterprise architecture and defines the tailored architecture framework and principles.
    
2. **Phase A - [[Architecture Vision]]**: Involves the development of a high-level vision of the architecture that supports the business strategy.
    
3. **Phase B - [[Business Architecture]]**: Defines the business strategy, governance, organization, and key business processes of the organization.
    
4. **Phase C - Information Systems Architectures**:
    - **Data Architecture**: Details the structure of an organization's logical and physical data assets and data management resources.
    - **Application Architecture**: Provides a blueprint for the individual application systems to be deployed, their interactions, and their relationships to the core business processes.
5. **Phase D - Technology Architecture**: Describes the logical software and hardware capabilities required to support the deployment of business, data, and application services.
    
6. **Phase E - Opportunities and Solutions**: Identifies delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases.
    
7. **Phase F - Migration Planning**: Addresses planning for the implementation of the architecture projects identified in Phase E.
    
8. **Phase G - Implementation Governance**: Provides an architectural oversight of the implementation.
    
9. **Phase H - Architecture Change Management**: Establishes procedures for managing changes to the new architecture.
    
10. **Requirements Management**: A central process that ensures that the Architecture Development Method responds to the dynamic nature of business drivers and changes in requirements.
