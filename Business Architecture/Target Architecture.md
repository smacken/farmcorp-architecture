The business function of Real-time Inventory Tracking typically involves several interrelated business processes to ensure accurate and up-to-the-minute data on inventory levels. Here are the key processes involved:

1. **Inventory Data Collection**: Utilizing technologies like RFID, barcodes, or IoT sensors to capture data on stock levels, movements, and locations within warehouses and storage facilities.
    
2. **Inventory Database Updates**: Automatically updating the central inventory database with real-time data collected from various points in the supply chain, ensuring that the system reflects current inventory levels.
    
3. **Stock Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitoring stock levels against predefined thresholds to trigger alerts or actions such as replenishment, stock redistribution, or excess stock liquidation. Involves interplay with the ERP MRP.
    
4. **Inventory Analysis and Reporting**: Analyzing real-time inventory data to generate reports and insights that help in decision-making regarding inventory optimization and management. Including 3pl & DC inventory as well as in transit supplier and customer orders.
    
5. **Integration with Supply Chain Management**: Ensuring that real-time inventory data is seamlessly integrated with other supply chain management processes, such as procurement, sales, and logistics.
    
6. **Demand-Supply Reconciliation**: Reconciling real-time inventory levels with current demand forecasts to adjust procurement and production plans accordingly.
    
7. **Replenishment Automation**: Automating the replenishment process based on real-time inventory tracking to maintain optimal stock levels and prevent stockouts or overstocking.
    
8. **Asset Tracking and Management**: Tracking the location and status of assets throughout the supply chain, from inbound shipments to warehouse storage and outbound logistics.
    
9. **Inventory Visibility for Stakeholders**: Providing stakeholders, including warehouse managers, procurement teams, and sales personnel, with access to real-time inventory information for informed decision-making.
    
10. **Audit and Compliance**: Assisting in inventory audits by providing real-time data and ensuring compliance with internal controls and external regulatory requirements regarding inventory management.
    

Each of these processes contributes to the effectiveness of Real-time Inventory Tracking, enabling Farm Corporation to maintain accurate inventory records, optimize stock levels, and respond swiftly to changes in demand or supply conditions.
