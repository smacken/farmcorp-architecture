In this architecture, the ERP system acts as the backbone, integrating various aspects of our operations, including finance, supply chain, production, human resources, and inventory management. The CRM system manages all customer interactions, from sales to service support, while providing valuable analytics. Our precision agriculture platform encompasses a range of services from fleet management to yield analysis, crucial for our smart farming solutions.

The Dealer Management System (DMS) is tailored to support our dealers with sales, service, parts inventory, and analytics. The Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system handles the design, compliance, and data management for our products. The Supply Chain Management (SCM) system ensures efficient vendor relationships and logistics operations.

Our Business Intelligence (BI) system, which includes data warehousing, reporting, and dashboards, provides insights and analytics to inform strategic decisions. The Manufacturing Execution System (MES) directly controls and monitors production on the factory floor. The Retail & Wholesale Finance System manages financing for dealers and customers.

Lastly, the Human Capital Management (HCM) system oversees employee-related processes, and the Environmental Health & Safety (EHS) system ensures compliance with regulations and company safety policies.

These components are interconnected, with data flowing between them to ensure seamless operations, informed decision-making, and exceptional customer service. This architecture is designed to be scalable and adaptable, capable of integrating new technologies and responding to the evolving needs of the agricultural industry.
